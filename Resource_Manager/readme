variables.tf
  Defines inputs for the module: create_service_users, identity_domain_endpoint, issuer, trust_name, and public_key_endpoint.
  These values drive user creation and the trust setup.

service_users.json
  List of service users and match rules (username, claim_name, claim_value, operator = eq/co).
  Used by Terraform to create users and to build impersonation rules.

service_users.tf
  Reads and cleans service_users.json, filters empty entries, and normalizes the operator.
  If create_service_users is true, it creates each as an service user.

trust.tf
  Collects created user IDs, validates operators, and checks for missing users.
  Creates an Identity Propagation Trust with dynamic impersonation rules that map JWT claims to user IDs; outputs trust_id.

confidential_app.tf
  Creates a confidential OAuth app (client credentials grant) in the Identity Domain using a base template.
  Exposes the created appâ€™s client identifier via the client_id output.
